 # Clicker Game

 A game where the point is to click... a lot. Sounds super fun right...? Right!

------------

### What is it?

Starting out as a small project I was tinkering with whilst on SoC, I have now began to make it playable and a lot more polished. The premise is simple. You are in charge of a kingdom of stick people. You must improve your kingdom in order to gain unseen riches - or else it shall fall.

### How to use

You must use the resource buttons at the bottom of the display in order to harvest resources (who would've thought right?) in order to purchase upgrades to increase throughput and population cap of your kingdom. The game is still super early in development, but I really enjoy working on it, so I would expect it to be finished within about two weeks or so! :)

As of now, the game only will run properly on a Desktop monitor (roughly any size).

### Known Bugs

Well... I'm sure there are many MANY bugs at the moment. BUT the only one I can really find is when you finish an upgrade tree - the game will throw an error. This is a super simple fix, I just have not got round to it yet, but it's next on the list!

### What next?

Being able to add and take away stick people from their job and place them into another is the thing I am currently working on.

Make it responsive... so you know... the huge majority of people who look at this can actually use it. (Whoops).

Ideally - I would like to add a threat. I.e some form of combat system where you battle some goblins or something realistic like that.
